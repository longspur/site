Hello! This site is incredibly under construction. I mostly wanted to create a site for some of my personal creative projects... but what I wanted to do was something that I would have create myself from scratch. So I figured while I'm learning all this, why not just make a personal site anyways? That, and I haven't really been into using social media very much lately.

I like minimalist layouts and this is my first foray into coding something from scratch by myself. Currently, sidebar images are [dithered photography](https://www.dithermark.com/) I've taken myself. Other assets around the site are usually from Pokemon.
