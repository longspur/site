Hello! This site is incredibly under construction. I mostly wanted to create a site for some of my personal creative projects... but what I wanted to do was something that I would have create myself from scratch. So I figured while I'm learning all this, why not just make a personal site anyways? As I've been a bit disillusioned with social media for a while now.

I like minimalist layouts and this is my first foray into coding something from scratch by myself... hoping to have things mostly mobile responsive as well.
