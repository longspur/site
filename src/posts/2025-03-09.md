From a really good [cover of Kingfisher by Joanna Newsom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Fy4_oo_CA) that came up in my recommended I found this NYC-based orchestra that has done a lot of covers of musicians I love (Owen Pallett especially).

Particular highlights are Troy by Sinéad O’Connor, In California by Joanna Newsom, and This Lamb Sells Condos by Owen Pallett.
