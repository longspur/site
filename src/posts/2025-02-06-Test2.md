This is a placeholder for now so I can see if my blog is working. This evening, I cooked some mushrooms, onions, and spinach in a wine sauce with a little broth and thyme/salt/pepper. I added a splash of cream but it honestly ruined the vibes just a little bit.

I then later made some oatmeal with some chai masala I had. I thought it'd make some pleasant chai oatmeal, but the spices were *very strong* and really overpowered the oatmeal. Definitely intended for its original usage of adding to tea in a larger pot on the stovetop, and not a little bowl of half a cup of oats...
