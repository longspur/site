### Ingredients
- 1/2 can of Maesri Green Curry Paste
- 1 can of coconut milk
- 2 chicken boullion cubes
- a splash of soy sauce
- 1 package of frozen broccoli
- 1 yellow onion, sliced
- 1 block of extra firm tofu
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- a smattering of grated ginger

An *extremely* loose adaptation of [this recipe](https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-green-curry/) using things that were in my fridge and freezer. I used half-ish a can of the green curry paste because I made a red curry once with the full can, and it was nearly nuclear. This was still spicy, but much more easily edible. The rest of the paste I froze into cubes.

Adding frozen broccoli weirdly enough changed the flavor of the sauce a lot, so I added another boullion cube and some soy sauce to try to offset the... broccoli-ness.

Either way, this made a huge batch. If I had the energy, sauteeing the broccoli (or at least seasoning it) a little or making crispy tofu would have elevated this dish a lot more.
