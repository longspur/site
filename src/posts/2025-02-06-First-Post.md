This is the first post on the blog! It took a bit of searching to figure out how to set this up. A lot of blogs use Zonelets, which is cool but Javascript based and I was having trouble getting it to slot neatly into how I've currently set up this site with 11ty. [This tutorial](https://renkotsuban.neocities.org/posts/2023-11-15-Migrating-to-Eleventy) ended up being exactly what I was looking for, with some modifications as I had already built the site layout and base structure.

This is pretty basic for now, but I'm very happy I got it working! In the future I'd like to add a header of some sorts for current weather/what I'm currently listening to... kind of reminiscent of old DeviantArt journals.

Posts can also be tagged and sorted, I haven't quite figured out how to display those yet. But I can see them. I'll have to think of other ways to categorize my journalling.
