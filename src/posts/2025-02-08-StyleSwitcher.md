Figured out something I had been wanting to implement, but couldn't figure out a few days ago... but now got it to work! There is a dropdown currently in the ~~sidebar~~ footer (moved to make it a little more mobile friendly) that allows toggling between different themes. This is called a "styleswitcher" or "theme toggle". Once I get around to making some more themes, you can browse in a color palette of your choice. Eventually when I make the OC section of this site, I want to make some that are "character" or setting themed layouts.

This was made with the help of [Kalechips tutorial](https://kalechips.net/projects/snippets/styleswitcher) (though as a code snippet, some external research was done to understand how the script was working).

I'll make this look better on mobile at some point, the mobile header--while technically functional--is another beast entirely that I'd like to make prettier.
